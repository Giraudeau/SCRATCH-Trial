# SCRATCH-Trial
Statistical code of the SCRATCH trial

These three files correspond to the statitical analysis of the primary outcome of the SCRATCH trial.
Three populations were considered:
1 - Clusters (the binary outcome is then a success when all cluster members were cured at Day28)
2 - Index cases (i.e., whether index cases were cured or not at Day 28)
3 - Cluster members, including index cases (i.e., for each cluster member the outcome was his/her status at Day 28, i.e., cured or not)

For each population, 3 analyses were perfomed:
1 - Completers: only those assessed at Day 28 were considered
2 - All participants: analyses then used multiple imputation
3 - Compliant participants: only those who received two doses and were assessed at Day 28 were considered
